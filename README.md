Backup and Archiving Program

The Backup and Archiving Program is a Python script that performs the following tasks:

Copies files from a source directory to a backup directory
Creates a timestamped backup directory to ensure uniqueness
Creates a zip archive of the backup directory
Removes the backup directory after archiving
Prerequisites
Python 3.x should be installed on your system.
Ensure that the required packages, os, shutil, datetime, and zipfile, are available.
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the backup_and_archive.py file in a text editor.

Modify the following variables in the code:

source_directory: Specify the path to the source directory you want to back up.
destination_directory: Specify the path to the destination directory where the backup and archive will be stored.
Save the changes to the backup_and_archive.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the backup_and_archive.py file is located.

Run the program by executing the following command:
python backup_and_archive.py


The program will create a timestamped backup directory, copy files from the source directory to the backup directory, create a zip archive of the backup directory, and remove the backup directory after archiving.

After the program finishes execution, you will see a message indicating that the backup and archiving process is completed successfully.

Customization
You can modify the source_directory and destination_directory variables to specify your desired source and destination directories.
